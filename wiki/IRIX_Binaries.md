# IRIX Binaries

## Recommended: Uploaded tardists

We are uploading tardists of packages at [sgi.retrote.ch](http://sgi.retrote.ch/index.html)!

## GCC

[https://esp.iki.fi/gcc-4.7.4-irix-3.tgz](https://esp.iki.fi/gcc-4.7.4-irix-3.tgz)

Cross-built on a Linux host. Includes GNU binutils 2.17.

This is an updated version, fixing a couple of stupidities in the previous tarball. After installing it, edit /opt/local/gcc-4.7.4/libexec/gcc/mips-sgi-irix6.5/4.7.4/install-tools/mkheaders to point to your copy of bash (it appears in three places in the file) and run the script to get fixed versions of headers in /opt/local/gcc-4.7.4/lib/gcc/mips-sgi-irix6.5/4.7.4/include-fixed.

## GNU grep 3.1

[https://esp.iki.fi/irix-gnu-grep.tgz](https://esp.iki.fi/irix-gnu-grep.tgz)

This supports the -r option, making it rather useful for finding out where something is #defined.

## "Lots of stuff"

[https://esp.iki.fi/irix-optlocal.tgz](https://esp.iki.fi/irix-optlocal.tgz)

Inside the file there is an optlocal.profile file which sets rld search paths accordingly.

**NOTE**: this includes an /etc/sudoers file with my username. Replace with yours instead of blaming onre for trying to hack you.

**NOTE**: curl expects to find a cacert.pem containing certificates in /opt/local/etc. You can get it here: [https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem).
